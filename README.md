AI-Medical-Report-RAG ðŸ”Ž
Project Overview
This is an AI-powered medical assistant that uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system to provide accurate, context-aware answers from a dataset of medical reports. The application offers a user-friendly interface to search medical data and receive concise, cited responses.

It leverages Streamlit for the web interface, LangChain for the RAG pipeline, FAISS for fast vector search, and Google Gemini 1.5 Flash for generating answers.

Prompt Engineering
A key part of this project is the prompt engineering used to make the AI safe and reliable. The prompt acts as a set of rules that transforms the LLM into a specialized medical assistant. It instructs the model to:

Use only the provided context. This prevents the model from hallucinating or generating information it hasn't seen.

Provide citations. The model is trained to generate responses with clear citations ([S1], [S2]) to make answers verifiable.

Adhere to a role. The prompt defines the AI as a "careful medical assistant," guiding its tone and behavior to be professional and cautious.
